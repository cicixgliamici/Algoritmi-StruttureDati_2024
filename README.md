# Data Structures-Driven Food Order Management System

## Project Overview
This project is a robust and modular Food Order Management System implemented in C. It simulates the process of managing ingredients, recipes, and orders using advanced data structures such as hash tables, min-heaps, max-heaps, and queues. The system efficiently handles ingredient inventory, recipe management, order processing, and truck shipment planning.

## Key Features

### 1. Ingredient Management
- **Hash Table of Min-Heaps**: Stores ingredient lots ordered by expiration date (and lexicographically by lot if needed).  
- **Real-time Tracking**: Efficiently removes expired ingredient lots and keeps track of total available quantities.

### 2. Recipe Management
- **Hash Table of Linked Lists**: Rapid insertion, search, and deletion of recipes.
- **Multi-Ingredient Recipes**: Supports customizable quantities for each recipe.

### 3. Order Processing
- **FIFO Queue**: Manages pending orders to preserve the order of arrival.
- **Min-Heap**: Prioritizes orders based on arrival time for timely delivery.

### 4. Truck Shipment Optimization
- **Max-Heap**: Optimizes truck loading based on the total order weight.
- **Tie-Break by Arrival Time**: In cases of equal weight, orders with an earlier arrival time are prioritized.

## Skills Acquired

1. **Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms**  
   - Developed and implemented hash tables, min-heaps, max-heaps, and queues from scratch in C.

2. **Modular Programming**  
   - Broke down a complex system into multiple files (header, main, data structures, orders) with a clear separation of concerns.

3. **Memory Management**  
   - Gained in-depth knowledge of dynamic memory allocation and optimization in C, ensuring robust and efficient code.

4. **Performance Optimization**  
   - Achieved O(1) average-case operations for hash table lookups and O(log n) operations for heap insertions and deletions.

5. **Problem Solving**  
   - Addressed real-world challenges like inventory expiration management and order prioritization through careful algorithm design.

## Future Enhancements

1. Error Handling: Improve input validation and error reporting.
2. Extended Functionality: Add features for a more interactive ordering system.
